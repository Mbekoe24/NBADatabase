# Title:

[NBA Player Database](https://nbadatabase.netlify.com/)

# Project Description:

This is a NBA Player Database, which includes player list, stats and bio. This project was built using JavaScript, React.js, JSX, Storybook and CSS. I will be using the NBA's API data to display brief player bio's/stats on the screen. My goal is to make this database feel as dynamic and authenic as possible. To help conceptualize my project, I will be using React Router to help navigate back and forth through my pages, CSS grid, and flex for the structoring of each component, Storybook for the button I will be using throughout my site, and some JavaScripit to help organize my data.

# API:

- I will be using this NBA API (https://nba-players.herokuapp.com/)

- IMAGE & TEAM DATA: (https://gist.github.com/jaeyson/60fe551b9ffb82da517bc50893b61da7)

# MVP:

- I will use 3 storybook components/ 6 test using Jest.

# Post-MVP:
